# ToDo

This project was developed as a school assignment. The primary objective was to create an application that incorporates five design patterns and two algorithms, while adhering to the SOLID principles of software development.

The application is a To-Do List designed using WPF, allowing users to create, update and delete tasks. The main window showcases the task list, highlighting the most important task attributes for a clear overview. Users can access a more detailed view of each task through a 'Details' button, providing specifics of their tasks. 

The application employs two different sorting algorithms, chosen based on the number of tasks in the list. Users can sort the tasks by using the sorting buttons located next to the column titles. Additionally, the application addresses the possibility of accidental deletions by providing undo/redo buttons.

Design Patterns used: Builder, Command, Strategy, Repository and Proxy.

Algorithms used: Quicksort and Insertion Sort.
